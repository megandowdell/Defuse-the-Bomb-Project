Give the user two hexcode to perform bitwise arithmetic which will result in two hexcode which the user will connect to create the color of the hex code achieved. They will have to figure out if



Keypad:
Mix up keypad numbers (ex. Move row 1 2 3 to the bottom so keypad is 456, 789, 123, *0#

Buttons:
Flashing different colors


Toggles:
Specific sequence of the toggles (ex. On, on, off) defuses the bomb


Timer:
Speed up/slow down timer if the user does the wrong or right thing
Reset timer back to a higher countdown when it gets low (ex. When it hits 1 min, reset to 5 min if the user does something specific)
